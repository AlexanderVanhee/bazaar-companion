# bazaar-companion
 
GNOME extension that integrates [Bazaar](https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar) into GNOME Shell. Currently adds back the "App Details" menu item and makes it open Flatpak apps in Bazaar instead of GNOME Software.
The extension should work with any reasonably recent version of Bazaar.
